I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Calgary, under the joint supervision of Dr. Michael Jacobson Jr. and Dr. Ha Tran. My research interests include computational number theory and cryptography, with current focus on algorithms for computing invariants in algebraic number fields such as the class group, regulator and fundamental units.
