- [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/) is a fun website that provides accessible lessons on many different topics including mathematics and computer science.

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) a cool website introduced to me by my friend Evan. This is an archive of mathematically oriented programming problems whose difficulty ranges from very easy to extremely hard.
