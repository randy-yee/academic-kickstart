<!---I sometimes wonder why certain hobbies are considered more interesting than others. One of my former supervisors used to have a joke 'About Me' page which claimed that he loved to travel and cook and that he was interested in photography and fine wines. At the end, there was tiny hyperlinked word that led to his true interests which were much less extravagant, amounting to something like enjoying the show South Park.
In the same way, I always kind of wish I could tell people that I had hobbies which are traditionally cool, but have absolutely zero desire to pursue them.
Instead, I can say I like going to punk rock concerts, I'm interested in psychological phenomena, --->

## Fun mathematical resources:

- [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/) is a fun website that provides accessible lessons on many different topics including mathematics and computer science.

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) This is an archive of mathematically oriented programming problems whose difficulty ranges from very easy to extremely hard.
<!--- This is a trial for creating a new page and linking to it via the homepage. The keys are that this page's title determines the url, and it must be changed accordingly in the "config/_default/menu.toml" file. --->

## Helpful mathematical and cryptography resources
- [ePrint](https://eprint.iacr.org/)
- [AnotherLook.ca](http://anotherlook.ca/)
- [Keith Conrad's Expository Papers](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/) a.k.a. my saving grace during grad school.
